"Good news for The Logan Society members [kiss_off/Stephen] and their allies. There's a new news article cited above that says we can rest assured as of now that the project is not dead, but will instead be put on permanent hiatus for the foreseeable future. There's no official reason for the decision, though we can hazard some guesses which do have Hexpoint infringements tolement, and multiple individuals have already taken to Discord to say it isn't a good idea. Keep in mind that this article is authored by the person who actually contacted Hexpoint directly, and he contradicted the article's claims up and down in more subtle ways."
They also posted a mod update to say you'll be able to enjoy the latest newsletters at the Society spiffy new Discord channel absolutely now! So that you can kick ass on the side with working accounts and sophisticated settings. Don't want to use the Discord voice chat however? There are plenty of professional art pledgers in your subverse who intend to keep you all happy with sounds/audio and graphics.
"Although no nearer to a decision on the Reidarth rally movie at that point, this supposed hiccup is generally seen as as just a sign of things to come as they will apparently deal with"
